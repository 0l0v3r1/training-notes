# Low and High-Level Languages

## 1.2 Low and high-level languages

* Low-Level languages are interpreted directly by the computer, they are powerful yet complicated, this complexity can lead to a vulnerability if the developer doesn't have a deep understanding of the language's capabilities (example: **assambly**)
* High-Level languages are easier, but they are less flexible (example: **Java**)
* Modern processors execute billions of operations per second, languages like assembly might be worth using for device drivers
* High-Level languages offer much more development convenience and support broader operations
* Programs created using high-level languages cannot reside on a bare OS, additional software is needed to run on the system
	* For Example: in order to run Java programs, you need to install (Java runtime Enviroment'')

**Nothing Interresting To Note Actually!**
