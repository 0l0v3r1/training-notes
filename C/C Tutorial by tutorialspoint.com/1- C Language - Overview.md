# Introduction

* C was originally developed by Dennis M. Ritchie to develop the UNIX operating system at Bell Labs
* The **UNIX operating system**, the **C compiler**, and essentially **all UNIX application programs** have been written in C
* C is a successor of B language which was introduced around the early 1970s
* C was adopted as a system development language because it produces code that runs nearly as fast as the code written in assembly language
