# Identifiers

- A C identifier is a name used to identify a variable, function, or any other user-defined item
- An identifier starts with a letter A to Z, a to z, or an underscore '_' followed by zero or more letters, underscores, and digits (0 to 9)
- C does not allow punctuation characters such as @, $, and % within identifiers
- C is a case-sensitive programming language. Thus, Manpower and manpower are two different identifiers in C
